##Introducing Myself!

###Hello Everyone, 

My name in _Mehran_, but you can call me _**Ron**_ (if it's easier for you!) ;-)

My interest in Web Development was mainly formed in accordance with my prior educations, as well as my newly planned personal career plans. As a new immigrant to the United States who has recently started a whole new life in San Diego, I am highly motivated to pursue my interest in building a career in IT industries.

####Educations:
* Civil Engineering (B.Sc.) 
* Urban Management (M.A.), 

During my higher educations I always maintained and followed my interest in IT, and both my dissertations in both programs were based on interdisciplinary topics related to IT.

####Experiences:
Over the past years (not continuously though) I started studying and taking preparation courses in both front-end and back-end web development, including:

1. HTML and CSS,
2. C#,
3. SQL,
4. ASP.NET. 

In addition, over the years of practical experience in printing and publishing industries, I have gained a foundation in graphics and design and have developed general knowledge and hands-on experience using some computer graphic and multimedia software packages.

####Goals:

In accordance with my prior research and work experience, my long-term goal is to become an IT Project Consultant. 

However to build up a U.S. work experience in this field, as my short-term goal I have decided to start working at technical levels after obtaining a vocational certificate in Web Development.

####Keep in Touch:

I am so excited and happy to be in this class with you guys, and hope we all can help and support each other on this path.
